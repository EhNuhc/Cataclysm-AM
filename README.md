# Cataclysm: Aftermath

Cataclysm: Aftermath is a fork of the apocalyptic roguelike simulation [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA). Our primary design run contrary to DDA, in that we're primarily interested in improving performance and code clarity, and providing a quality gameplay experience.
